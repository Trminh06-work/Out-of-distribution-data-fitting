# Out-of-distribution Data Fitting

A benchmark for studying **out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization** of ML/DL models on low-dimensional (up to 20 features), regression tabular data.

---

## 🎯 Key contributions

This repository encompasses code and documents for:

- Building and analysing **regression tabular benchmarks** for OOD data fitting  
- Exploring different **partition algorithms** for creating OOD partitions
- Performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization**
- Prototyping **ML/DL models** and evaluating them under distributional shifts and OOD extrapolation.

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/Trminh06-work/Out-of-distribution-data-fitting.git
    cd Out-of-distribution-data-fitting

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

On macOS / Linux:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

### 3. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🧪 Usage Examples

**NOTES (delete later)** Adjust imports and paths to match your actual code structure. 

### Load data and compute basic statistics

    from stat_sum_func import DatasetStatistics  # update path if different

    path = "data/raw/california/california.parquet"
    stats = DatasetStatistics(path)

    # Access underlying dataframe
    df = stats.df
    print(df.head())

    # Plot distribution of a single feature
    stats.plot_distribution("Longitude")

### Run partition algorithms

Due to GitHub resources constraints, the splitted data are not pushed to this repo. Hence, practitioners must re-run the `PartitionProcedure.ipynb` to obtain the splitted data. However, the statistics summary of the splitted data is provided to compare.

**NOTES (delete later)** Explain how to use the code in `partition_algs/`. For example:

    # Example placeholder – replace with real usage
    from partition_algs.some_module import create_partitions

    splits = create_partitions(df, target_column="median_house_value")
    train_id, test_ood = splits["train_id"], splits["test_ood"]
